as of now this program should:
use arcade drive using the joysticks (right for speed left for turning)
activate the transporter and intake (both use A to spin in and B to spin out and are toggeld on and off)
turn the robot arm motors with one motor using the start and back buttons to spin in different directions and the other using the right and left bumpers
the navX programs may cause errors since they are not in the robot file, remove them if they do
